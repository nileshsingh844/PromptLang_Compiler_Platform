What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)? SRE is what you get when you treat operations as if itâs a software problem. Our mission is to protect, provide for, and progress the software and systems behind all of Googleâs public services â Google Search, Ads, Gmail, Android, YouTube, and App Engine, to name just a few â with an ever-watchful eye on their availability, latency, performance, and capacity.
