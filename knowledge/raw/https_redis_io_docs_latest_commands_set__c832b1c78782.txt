If key already holds a value, it is overwritten, regardless of its type. Any previous time to live associated with the key is discarded on successful SET operation. Options The SET command supports a set of options that modify its behavior: NX -- Only set the key if it does not already exist. XX -- Only set the key if it already exists. IFEQ ifeq-value -- Set the keyâs value and expiration only if its current value is equal to ifeq-value . If the key doesnât exist, it wonât be created. IFNE ifne-value -- Set the keyâs value and expiration only if its current value is not equal to ifne-value . If the key doesnât exist, it will be created. IFDEQ ifeq-digest -- Set the keyâs value and expiration only if the hash digest of its current value is equal to ifeq-digest . If the key doesnât exist, it wonât be created. See the Hash Digest section below for more information. IFDNE ifne-digest -- Set the keyâs value and expiration only if the hash digest of its current value is not equal to ifne-digest . If the key doesnât exist, it will be created. See the Hash Digest section below for more information. GET -- Return the old string stored at key, or nil if key did not exist. An error is returned and SET aborted if the value stored at key is not a string. EX seconds -- Set the specified expire time, in seconds (a positive integer). PX milliseconds -- Set the specified expire time, in milliseconds (a positive integer). EXAT timestamp-seconds -- Set the specified Unix time at which the key will expire, in seconds (a positive integer). PXAT timestamp-milliseconds -- Set the specified Unix time at which the key will expire, in milliseconds (a positive integer). KEEPTTL -- Retain the time to live associated with the key. Note: Since the SET command options can replace SETNX , SETEX , PSETEX , GETSET , it is possible that in future versions of Redis these commands will be deprecated and finally removed. Hash Digest A hash digest is a fixed-size numerical representation of a string value, computed using the XXH3 hash algorithm. Redis uses this hash digest for efficient comparison operations without needing to compare the full string content. You can retrieve a key's hash digest using the DIGEST command, which returns it as a hexadecimal string that you can use with the IFDEQ and IFDNE options, and also the DELEX command's IFDEQ and IFDNE options.

The command SET resource-name anystring NX EX max-lock-time is a simple way to implement a locking system with Redis. A client can acquire the lock if the above command returns OK (or retry after some time if the command returns Nil), and remove the lock just using DEL . The lock will be auto-released after the expire time is reached. It is possible to make this system more robust modifying the unlock schema as follows: Instead of setting a fixed string, set a non-guessable large random string, called token. Instead of releasing the lock with DEL , send a script that only removes the key if the value matches. This avoids that a client will try to release the lock after the expire time deleting the key created by another client that acquired the lock later. An example of unlock script would be similar to the following: if redis.call("get",KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then return redis.call("del",KEYS[1]) else return 0 end The script should be called with EVAL ...script... 1 resource-name token-value Redis Enterprise and Redis Cloud compatibility Redis Enterprise Redis Cloud Notes â Standard â Active-Active â Standard â Active-Active Return information History Starting with Redis version 2.6.12: Added the EX , PX , NX and XX options.
